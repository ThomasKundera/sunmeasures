A standard photographic Sun filter was used.

Overexposed images (more than 20% of Sun disk image pixels saturated) are rejected from analysis.

## How to use

- git clone the repo
- run the script: code/bash/run_analysis.sh

It should create apython venev, install what's needed and process the data.


## Data analysis

- Fix time delta with reference images - ✅
- Measure Sun disk size - ✅
- Plot it against time - ✅
